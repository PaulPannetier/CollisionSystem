CollisionSystem is a C++ code package designed to handle 2D collisions.
The system supports most common 2D shapes:
Line
Ray (Directional line)
Circle
Hitbox
Capsule
Polygon

This package handles:

Point overlapping
Collision detection
Raycasting
Collider casting

I made this package for the collision system of my game Leap of Fury : https://github.com/PaulPannetier/Leap-Of-Fury
